Winter lake ice presents unique challenges to limnological research and science outreach. These challenges have slowed progress in understanding the responses of aquatic ecosystems to rapidly changing conditions associated with climate change. Unfortunately, few aquatic scientistsare trained for the unique challenges of limnological sampling on frozen lakes, including ice safety, operating standard limnological gear in subzero temperatures, collecting samples from under snow and ice cover, or even dressing for the cold, windy, and wet conditions winter limnologists routinely encounter.
