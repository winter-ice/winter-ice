    "text": "Winter lake ice presents unique challenges to limnological research and science outreach. These challenges have slowed progress in understanding the responses of aquatic ecosystems to rapidly changing conditions associated with climate change. Unfortunately, few aquatic scientistsare trained for the unique challenges of limnological sampling on frozen lakes, including ice safety, operating standard limnological gear in subzero temperatures, collecting samples from under snow and ice cover, or even dressing for the cold, windy, and wet conditions winter limnologists routinely encounter.\n In March, 2024, early-career limnologists gathered at Trout Lake Station in Wisconsin with five researchers experienced in winter limnology for a comprehensive Winter Limnology training workshop. Participants had a fully hands-on experience in conducting winter field research, and contributed to discussions about team science and science communication and outreach. Participants included graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and practicing conservation scientists from the US and Canada.\nThe workshop began with a full day of ice safety training led by professional ice safety trainers who normally work with first responders. Participants learned how to assess the relative safety of ice conditions, how to avoid accidents on the ice, how to help others in distress, and how to rescue themselves. It was a learning experience for everyone, including the ice-safety instructors who learned the word “limnology”!\n\nParticipants practiced with augers and ice saws to create holes for sampling, and set up ice tents for warmth. They then brainstormed research questions that might be addressed by two days of intensive sampling during our workshop, and set up the training to gather appropriate data. Participants worked with the workshop organizers to determine the safety of ice conditions at Trout Lake, and then practiced deploying standard sensors under ice as well as collecting samples for water chemistry and plankton counts. Participants also learned the technique for setting a line under ice, along which one could set a gillnet or set up bottles to incubate under undisturbed ice. Unable to resist the lure of cold water and the satisfaction of self-rescue, several participants jumped back into the lake in only a PFD and their clothes to experience the shock of falling through the ice and pulling themselves to safety with their ice picks, and a crew on ice ready to assist.\n\nA day was spent compiling and analyzing the data that were collected. Participants worked together under open science principles, and intend to develop formalized norms for collaboration, data sharing, and authorship as they continue to collaborate.\nOrganizers hope to be able to offer this training again in future winters, and look forward to our trainees contributing to winter knowledge in our project and beyond!\n\n\n\nThis workshop was supported by NSF award # 2306885 “Advancing a comprehensive model of year-round ecosystem function in seasonally frozen lakes through networked science”."

    "text": "Stephanie Hampton | Deputy Director, Division of Biosphere Sciences and Engineering, Carnegie Institution for Science\nStephanie Hampton’s research has progressed from basic investigations in aquatic ecology using statistical analysis of large-scale databases, to broader applications of empirical evidence in science and society. Her core expertise is in aquatic science, statistical analysis, and environmental informatics. Her research includes analyzing long-term ecological data collected from lakes as globally diverse as Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Washington in Seattle. Together with collaborators, she has shown how lakes respond to municipal management practices such as sewage diversion. She has also helped demonstrate the effects of climate change on plankton—the basic building blocks of aquatic food webs – with a recent emphasis on the implications of winter ice loss across the globe.\nLab Page"

Much of his work broadly examines how abiotic and biotic factors interact to control the structure and function of ecosystems. He studies watershed processes and terrestrial-aquatic linkages, the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients through ecosystems and food webs, and factors that regulate the metabolic function (i.e., respiration and primary production) of ponds, lakes and estuaries. Many of his current projects seek to understand and predict the effect of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems from local to global scales.\nLab Page"

    "text": "Trista Vick-Majors | Assistant Professor, Michigan Technological University\nTrista is a microbial ecologist who studies the reciprocal relationships between microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Microorganisms are widespread in the environment and are responsible for driving key elemental transformations that control the quality of our water and influence the greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere. She is interested in understanding how physical and chemical characteristics interact with microbial communities and influence or are influenced by microbial metabolism and diversity. Her work is also aimed at understanding energetic constraints on microbial metabolism that may result from ecosystem change or seasonal change, such as the formation of ice-cover. Field work locales span temperate environments with seasonal ice-cover, where rapid environmental change is affecting ice duration and thickness, and polar environments where ice-cover can be a permanent fixture. Her research occurs at the interface of microbial ecology and biogeochemistry.\nLab Page"

    "text": "Winter is the fastest warming season in the northern hemisphere. For millions of the world’s seasonally-frozen lakes, this warming means shorter and thinner ice cover and changing patterns of snow accumulation on the ice. Because ice and snow affect many fundamental physical, chemical, and biological properties of lakes, changes in winter conditions can disrupt lake ecosystems and the services they provide to humanity. Until recently, lake scientists paid relatively little attention to winter, meaning we know very little about how lakes work when covered by ice and snow and how winter conditions affect the rest of the year. This leaves scientists ill-prepared to predict how changing winters will impact lakes or to mitigate negative impacts. This study addresses this “winter knowledge gap” and develops a predictive understanding of how winter conditions affect the ecological populations, communities, and food webs of diverse types of lakes. Along with intensive studies of lakes by the core project team, the investigators are also recruiting researchers from dozens of institutions to expand sampling to many additional lakes. This “Team Science” approach will train many aquatic scientists in specialized winter sampling methods, empowering other scientists to include studies of winter conditions in their research programs. It will develop a network of winter-hardy aquatic researchers with the goal of advancing understanding of year-round ecosystem function in the face of climate change. The project provides education and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate students and a postbaccalaureate researcher.\nThis study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Ozersky: #2306885, Dugan: #2306888, Hampton: #2306886, Sadro: #2306889, Vick-Majors: #2306887)."
