    "text": "General Overview:\nLocation: University of Wisconsin Trout Lake Field Station\nDates: March 11-14, 2024 (with March 10 and 15 as travel days).\nAccommodations & meals: Accommodations in dorm-style cabins at the field station. Meals will be provided.\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter presents unique challenges to limnological research and science outreach. These challenges have slowed progress in understanding winter limnology and how winter conditions affect lakes through the full annual cycle. Rapidly changing winter climate and growing recognition of the ‘winter knowledge gap’ in limnology are attracting more and more researchers to study ice covered lakes.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, few of us are trained for the unique challenges of limnological sampling on frozen lakes, including ice safety, operating standard limnological gear in subzero temperatures, collecting samples from under snow and ice cover, and even dressing for the cold, windy, and wet conditions winter limnologists routinely encounter. In addition, much of recent winter limnology research is conducted by individual research teams focused on a small number of systems and domain-specific questions. This approach makes it difficult to discern generalizable patterns and test comprehensive hypotheses about the way winter conditions shape the ecology of diverse lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation recently funded two Winter Limnology projects (Advancing a comprehensive model of year-round ecosystem function in seasonally frozen lakes through networked science, award # 2306885 and On thin ice- implications of shorter winters for the future of freshwater phytoplankton phenology and function, award # 2306894). Both projects seek to rapidly advance understanding of winter limnology through large-scale, collaborative Team Science, involving dozens of research groups in collecting standardized samples across diverse lakes. To support these projects, we are hosting a Limnology Winter School event for early career and experienced limnologists interested in learning how to conduct winter research, expand their professional networks, and join us as collaborators on our Team Science projects.\n\n\nParticipants in the Limnology Winter School will join a team of experienced winter limnologists and outreach specialists at UW-Madison’s scenic Trout Lake Biological Station for 4 days of hands-on field work and discussions. Topics will include:\n\nPlanning and executing winter field operations\nIce safety and rescue\nCollecting standard limnological data and samples under ice\nPlanning and conducting public outreach during winter\nDiscussion of key open questions and novel hypotheses for winter limnology\nBest practices in Team Science\n\nTransportation, accommodations, and meals are fully covered for US and Canada-based participants through stipends on a need basis. We especially encourage participation by researchers interested in joining our Team Science effort (involving collecting winter and summer samples from their local lakes), early career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, pre-tenure faculty), and scientists from historically underrepresented backgrounds in the limnological sciences. No specialized winter gear beyond cold-weather clothing is needed to participate."

Her core expertise is in aquatic science, statistical analysis, and environmental informatics. Her research includes analyzing long-term ecological data collected from lakes as globally diverse as Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Washington in Seattle. Together with collaborators, she has shown how lakes respond to municipal management practices such as sewage diversion. She has also helped demonstrate the effects of climate change on plankton—the basic building blocks of aquatic food webs – with a recent emphasis on the implications of winter ice loss across the globe.\nLab Page"

Microorganisms are widespread in the environment and are responsible for driving key elemental transformations that control the quality of our water and influence the greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere. She is interested in understanding how physical and chemical characteristics interact with microbial communities and influence or are influenced by microbial metabolism and diversity. Her work is also aimed at understanding energetic constraints on microbial metabolism that may result from ecosystem change or seasonal change, such as the formation of ice-cover. Field work locales span temperate environments with seasonal ice-cover, where rapid environmental change is affecting ice duration and thickness, and polar environments where ice-cover can be a permanent fixture. Her research occurs at the interface of microbial ecology and biogeochemistry.\nLab Page"

    "text": "Winter is the fastest warming season in the northern hemisphere. For millions of the world’s seasonally-frozen lakes, this warming means shorter and thinner ice cover and changing patterns of snow accumulation on the ice. Because ice and snow affect many fundamental physical, chemical, and biological properties of lakes, changes in winter conditions can disrupt lake ecosystems and the services they provide to humanity. Until recently, lake scientists paid relatively little attention to winter, meaning we know very little about how lakes work when covered by ice and snow and how winter conditions affect the rest of the year. This leaves scientists ill-prepared to predict how changing winters will impact lakes or to mitigate negative impacts. This study addresses this “winter knowledge gap” and develops a predictive understanding of how winter conditions affect the ecological populations, communities, and food webs of diverse types of lakes. Along with intensive studies of lakes by the core project team, the investigators are also recruiting researchers from dozens of institutions to expand sampling to many additional lakes. This “Team Science” approach will train many aquatic scientists in specialized winter sampling methods, empowering other scientists to include studies of winter conditions in their research programs. It will develop a network of winter-hardy aquatic researchers with the goal of advancing understanding of year-round ecosystem function in the face of climate change. The project provides education and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate students and a postbaccalaureate researcher.\nThis study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Ozersky: #2306885, Dugan: #2306888, Hampton: #2306886, Sadro: #2306889, Vick-Majors: #2306887)."
