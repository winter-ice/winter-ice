    "text": "Join early-career and experienced limnologists at Trout Lake Biological Station in Wisconsin for a comprehensive Winter Limnology workshop (Including travel days, March 10-15, 2024). Gain experience in conducting winter field research and K-12 outreach, expand your professional network, and learn how you can participate in a new NSF-funded Team Science winter limnology project.\n\n\nLocation: University of Wisconsin Trout Lake Field Station\nDates: March 11-14, 2024 (with March 10 and 15 as travel days).\nAccommodations & meals: Accommodations in dorm-style cabins at the field station. Meals will be provided.\n\n\nWinter presents unique challenges to limnological research and science outreach. These challenges have slowed progress in understanding winter limnology and how winter conditions affect lakes through the full annual cycle. Rapidly changing winter climate and growing recognition of the ‘winter knowledge gap’ in limnology are attracting more and more researchers to study ice covered lakes.\nUnfortunately, few of us are trained for the unique challenges of limnological sampling on frozen lakes, including ice safety, operating standard limnological gear in subzero temperatures, collecting samples from under snow and ice cover, and even dressing for the cold, windy, and wet conditions winter limnologists routinely encounter. In addition, much of recent winter limnology research is conducted by individual research teams focused on a small number of systems and domain-specific questions. This approach makes it difficult to discern generalizable patterns and test comprehensive hypotheses about the way winter conditions shape the ecology of diverse lakes.\nThe National Science Foundation recently funded two Winter Limnology projects (Advancing a comprehensive model of year-round ecosystem function in seasonally frozen lakes through networked science, award # 2306885 and On thin ice- implications of shorter winters for the future of freshwater phytoplankton phenology and function, award # 2306894). Both projects seek to rapidly advance understanding of winter limnology through large-scale, collaborative Team Science, involving dozens of research groups in collecting standardized samples across diverse lakes. To support these projects, we are hosting a Limnology Winter School event for early career and experienced limnologists interested in learning how to conduct winter research, expand their professional networks, and join us as collaborators on our Team Science projects.\nParticipants in the Limnology Winter School will join a team of experienced winter limnologists and outreach specialists at UW-Madison’s scenic Trout Lake Biological Station for 4 days of hands-on field work and discussions. Topics will include:\n\nPlanning and executing winter field operations\nIce safety and rescue\nCollecting standard limnological data and samples under ice\nPlanning and conducting public outreach during winter\nDiscussion of key open questions and novel hypotheses for winter limnology\nBest practices in Team Science\n\nTransportation, accommodations, and meals are fully covered for US and Canada-based participants through stipends on a need basis. We especially encourage participation by researchers interested in joining our Team Science effort (involving collecting winter and summer samples from their local lakes), early career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, pre-tenure faculty), and scientists from historically underrepresented backgrounds in the limnological sciences. No specialized winter gear beyond cold-weather clothing is needed to participate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe fully engaged in workshop events listed in the agenda, for the full workshop, and able to set aside regular work distractions\nContinue to engage collaboratively in writing products/manuscripts after the workshop ends\nAbide by the workshop code of conduct\nComplete some pre-workshop activities prior to arriving\n\n\n\n\nParticipant travel, accommodation, and meal costs for US and Canada-based participants will be reimbursed through a stipend on a needs basis. Requests for funding can be indicated in the online application.\n\n\n\n\nSunday, March 10:\n\nTravel day, arrive at Trout Lake\nWelcome dinner\nIntroductions and networking\n\nMonday, March 11:\n\nBreakfast\nIntroduction to workshop and the Winter Limnology Network\nPlanning winter field operations: clothing, gear, access, safety considerations\nLunch\nIce safety and rescue- theory and practice\nDinner\nDiscussion and networking:\n\n                Objectives of the Winter Limnology Network\nTuesday, March 12:\n\nBreakfast\nWinter limnology field practice\nLunch\nWinter limnology field practice\nDinner\nDiscussion and networking:\n\n                Overcoming challenges of winter sampling\nWednesday, March 13:\n\nBreakfast\nWinter outreach with local middle school students\nLunch\nDiscussions and working groups\nAddressing novel hypotheses using the Winter Limnology Network\nDinner\nDiscussion and networking:\n\n                Addressing novel hypotheses using the Winter Limnology Network\nThursday, March 14:\n\nBreakfast\nDiscussions and working groups:\nAddressing novel hypotheses using the Winter Limnology Network\nMaintaining momentum for collaboration\nLunch\nDiscussions and working groups:\n\n                Maintaining momentum for collaboration\n\nReporting out\nDinner\nSummary and networking\n\nFriday, March 15:\n\nBreakfast\nDeparture, travel day\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces in the workshop are limited. Applicants will be prioritized based on interest in participation in follow up sampling through the Winter Research Network, applicant career stage, and self-described status as members of groups historically underrepresented in limnology.\nApplications are due on January 15, 2024. Successful applicants will be contacted by January 22, 2024."

    "text": "Winter is the fastest warming season in the northern hemisphere. For millions of the world’s seasonally-frozen lakes, this warming means shorter and thinner ice cover and changing patterns of snow accumulation on the ice. Because ice and snow affect many fundamental physical, chemical, and biological properties of lakes, changes in winter conditions can disrupt lake ecosystems and the services they provide to humanity. Until recently, lake scientists paid relatively little attention to winter, meaning we know very little about how lakes work when covered by ice and snow and how winter conditions affect the rest of the year. This leaves scientists ill-prepared to predict how changing winters will impact lakes or to mitigate negative impacts. This study addresses this “winter knowledge gap” and develops a predictive understanding of how winter conditions affect the ecological populations, communities, and food webs of diverse types of lakes. Along with intensive studies of lakes by the core project team, the investigators are also recruiting researchers from dozens of institutions to expand sampling to many additional lakes. This “Team Science” approach will train many aquatic scientists in specialized winter sampling methods, empowering other scientists to include studies of winter conditions in their research programs. It will develop a network of winter-hardy aquatic researchers with the goal of advancing understanding of year-round ecosystem function in the face of climate change. The project provides education and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate students and a postbaccalaureate researcher.\nThis study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Ozersky: #2306885, Dugan: #2306888, Hampton: #2306886, Sadro: #2306889, Vicks-Major: #2306887)."
